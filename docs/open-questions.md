# Open questions

The register of everything asked of Patric. A question gets the next number here before it is
asked in chat, chat refers to that number, and Patric answers by number, in any conversation.
Numbers are never reused: an answered question gets its line in `decisions.md` and leaves this
file. Each one is tagged with its part and names what is blocked and the smaller option, so
answering is quick. Next number: 28.

## 2. Protected paths created by an agent

`schemas/`, `acceptance/` and `golden/fake/` did not exist before. CODEOWNERS now protects the
first two, so this is the one time they are created without a prior review. They need your read.

## 5. There are no business rules, and none can be written yet

`engine/rules/run.ts` computes nothing. It guarantees `display` exists and gives rules one place to
live. Earlier it formatted prices, areas, room counts, addresses and slugs; all of that was
invented from the SRS's illustrative example and has been removed.

A rule needs two things first: a field to compute over, and a ledger entry saying what the output
should be. `rules-ledger/` is protected and empty, so nothing can be written until an entry exists.

## 6. Images, when the model is defined

Kowboy serves images through a separate CDN app. The SRS says images are CRM CDN URLs with a sort
order (§6.6), but there is no image field in the contract today and none will be added on a guess.
When the model is defined, say whether Core carries image URLs at all or leaves them out entirely.

## 8. Phase 1 cannot exit without the platform

Phase 1's exit is a real PR → staging → production deploy, and AC 18, 24, 27 need a live
environment. The app is built to run on DigitalOcean App Platform with managed Postgres, but
nothing is deployed. Phase 1 is split in the strategy into Foundation (done) and Deploy (waiting
on you).

## 9. The adapter API cannot stamp an adapter's own events

`logEvent(type, fields)` writes a row with no correlation id and no entity reference, so an
adapter's own events (a webhook arriving, a CRM call and its timing) cannot be linked to the write
they caused. `ingest` does take a correlation id, so the chain works from the fetch onwards, and
the fake adapter proves it.

AC 16 asks for one query returning the whole timeline **across webhook, fetch, CRM call, write,
bell and pull**. Meeting it fully needs one added argument:

```ts
logEvent(type, fields, context?: { correlationId?, connectionId?, datatype?, remoteId? })
```

That is an adapter API change, so it needs approval (E3). It is additive and breaks no caller.

## 16. The plugin's license, now that Action Scheduler is bundled

Action Scheduler is GPLv3, and a plugin that ships it is GPL-derived, as WordPress plugins normally
are. The plugin header has no `License:` line. Suggested: `License: GPL-3.0-or-later` in
`clients/wordpress/core-client/core-client.php`. Your call; nothing else depends on it.

## 27. `[core]` `[crm-vitec]` `[client-wordpress]` `[client-lovable]` Previews: where does the agent get the link?

A preview is a property page the seller can see before the property is public. The property is
on the website but hidden, and a secret link opens it. When the link is opened, the website first
fetches the latest data from Core, then shows the page, so the seller always sees the newest
version. There are two ways for the agent to get that link:

- **A. From the website.** The agent copies the link from the website's admin. Nothing in Core
  changes. This can be built with the templates once the data model is in.
- **B. From Vitec Express.** The agent clicks "Förhandsgranska" in Express, Vitec asks Core to
  fetch the property, waits until the website has it, and opens the page. Nothing to copy. For
  this Core must know each customer's website address, which is a small addition to Core, and
  Vitec must be told Core's address.

Suggested: A first, B after. Say yes, or say B only. The first, technical wording of this question
(the endpoints, the token) is settled by the suggestion and needs no answer.
